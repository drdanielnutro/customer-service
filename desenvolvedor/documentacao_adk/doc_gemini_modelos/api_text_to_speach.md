Speech generation (text-to-speech)

The Gemini API can transform text input into single speaker or multi-speaker audio using native text-to-speech (TTS) generation capabilities. Text-to-speech (TTS) generation is controllable, meaning you can use natural language to structure interactions and guide the style, accent, pace, and tone of the audio.

The TTS capability differs from speech generation provided through the Live API, which is designed for interactive, unstructured audio, and multimodal inputs and outputs. While the Live API excels in dynamic conversational contexts, TTS through the Gemini API is tailored for scenarios that require exact text recitation with fine-grained control over style and sound, such as podcast or audiobook generation.

This guide shows you how to generate single-speaker and multi-speaker audio from text.

Preview: Native text-to-speech (TTS) is in Preview.
Before you begin
Ensure you use a Gemini 2.5 model variant with native text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities, as listed in the Supported models section. For optimal results, consider which model best fits your specific use case.

You may find it useful to test the Gemini 2.5 TTS models in AI Studio before you start building.

Note: TTS models accept text-only inputs and produce audio-only outputs. For a complete list of restrictions specific to TTS models, review the Limitations section.
Single-speaker text-to-speech
To convert text to single-speaker audio, set the response modality to "audio", and pass a SpeechConfig object with VoiceConfig set. You'll need to choose a voice name from the prebuilt output voices.

This example saves the output audio from the model in a wave file:

Python
JavaScript
REST

from google import genai
from google.genai import types
import wave

# Set up the wave file to save the output:
def wave_file(filename, pcm, channels=1, rate=24000, sample_width=2):
   with wave.open(filename, "wb") as wf:
      wf.setnchannels(channels)
      wf.setsampwidth(sample_width)
      wf.setframerate(rate)
      wf.writeframes(pcm)

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
   model="gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts",
   contents="Say cheerfully: Have a wonderful day!",
   config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
      response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
      speech_config=types.SpeechConfig(
         voice_config=types.VoiceConfig(
            prebuilt_voice_config=types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
               voice_name='Kore',
            )
         )
      ),
   )
)

data = response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].inline_data.data

file_name='out.wav'
wave_file(file_name, data) # Saves the file to current directory

Multi-speaker text-to-speech
For multi-speaker audio, you'll need a MultiSpeakerVoiceConfig object with each speaker (up to 2) configured as a SpeakerVoiceConfig. You'll need to define each speaker with the same names used in the prompt:

Python
JavaScript
REST

from google import genai
from google.genai import types
import wave

# Set up the wave file to save the output:
def wave_file(filename, pcm, channels=1, rate=24000, sample_width=2):
   with wave.open(filename, "wb") as wf:
      wf.setnchannels(channels)
      wf.setsampwidth(sample_width)
      wf.setframerate(rate)
      wf.writeframes(pcm)

client = genai.Client()

prompt = """TTS the following conversation between Joe and Jane:
         Joe: How's it going today Jane?
         Jane: Not too bad, how about you?"""

response = client.models.generate_content(
   model="gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts",
   contents=prompt,
   config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
      response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
      speech_config=types.SpeechConfig(
         multi_speaker_voice_config=types.MultiSpeakerVoiceConfig(
            speaker_voice_configs=[
               types.SpeakerVoiceConfig(
                  speaker='Joe',
                  voice_config=types.VoiceConfig(
                     prebuilt_voice_config=types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
                        voice_name='Kore',
                     )
                  )
               ),
               types.SpeakerVoiceConfig(
                  speaker='Jane',
                  voice_config=types.VoiceConfig(
                     prebuilt_voice_config=types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
                        voice_name='Puck',
                     )
                  )
               ),
            ]
         )
      )
   )
)

data = response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].inline_data.data

file_name='out.wav'
wave_file(file_name, data) # Saves the file to current directory
Controlling speech style with prompts
You can control style, tone, accent, and pace using natural language prompts for both single- and multi-speaker TTS. For example, in a single-speaker prompt, you can say:


Say in an spooky whisper:
"By the pricking of my thumbs...
Something wicked this way comes"
In a multi-speaker prompt, provide the model with each speaker's name and corresponding transcript. You can also provide guidance for each speaker individually:


Make Speaker1 sound tired and bored, and Speaker2 sound excited and happy:

Speaker1: So... what's on the agenda today?
Speaker2: You're never going to guess!
Try using a voice option that corresponds to the style or emotion you want to convey, to emphasize it even more. In the previous prompt, for example, Enceladus's breathiness might emphasize "tired" and "bored", while Puck's upbeat tone could complement "excited" and "happy".

Generating a prompt to convert to audio
The TTS models only output audio, but you can use other models to generate a transcript first, then pass that transcript to the TTS model to read aloud.

Python
JavaScript

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

transcript = client.models.generate_content(
   model="gemini-2.0-flash",
   contents="""Generate a short transcript around 100 words that reads
            like it was clipped from a podcast by excited herpetologists.
            The hosts names are Dr. Anya and Liam.""").text

response = client.models.generate_content(
   model="gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts",
   contents=transcript,
   config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
      response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
      speech_config=types.SpeechConfig(
         multi_speaker_voice_config=types.MultiSpeakerVoiceConfig(
            speaker_voice_configs=[
               types.SpeakerVoiceConfig(
                  speaker='Dr. Anya',
                  voice_config=types.VoiceConfig(
                     prebuilt_voice_config=types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
                        voice_name='Kore',
                     )
                  )
               ),
               types.SpeakerVoiceConfig(
                  speaker='Liam',
                  voice_config=types.VoiceConfig(
                     prebuilt_voice_config=types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
                        voice_name='Puck',
                     )
                  )
               ),
            ]
         )
      )
   )
)
